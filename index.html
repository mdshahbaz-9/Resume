                    <p>My name is Md Shahbaz, and I am currently pursuing my BCA (Bachelor of Computer Applications) 
                    degree from Hazaribagh, Jharkhand. I reside in the beautiful town of Koderama. As a person,
                     I am known for my problem-solving skills and my ability to tackle challenges head-on. I have 
                     always been fascinated by the world of technology and computers. From a young age, I developed a keen interest
                      in understanding how things work, especially when it comes to solving complex problems. This curiosity led me to 
                      choose a career path in the field of computer science. </td></p>
